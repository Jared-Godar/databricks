## OVERVIEW

- The Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark 3.0 certification exam assesses an understanding of the basics of the Spark architecture and the ability to apply the Spark DataFrame API to complete individual data manipulation tasks.
- These tasks include:
  - selecting, renaming and manipulating columns
  - filtering, dropping, sorting, and aggregating rows; handling missing data
  - combining, reading, writing and partitioning DataFrames with schemas
  - and working with UDFs and Spark SQL functions.
- In addition, the exam will assess the basics of the Spark architecture like execution/deployment modes, the execution hierarchy, fault tolerance, garbage collection, and broadcasting.

## PREREQUISITES

- The minimally qualified candidate should:
  - have a basic understanding of the Spark architecture, including Adaptive Query Execution
  - be able to apply the Spark DataFrame API to complete individual data manipulation task, including: 
    - selecting, renaming and manipulating columns
    - filtering, dropping, sorting, and aggregating rows
    - joining, reading, writing and partitioning DataFrames
    - working with UDFs and Spark SQL functions
- It is expected that developers that have been using the Spark DataFrame API for six months or more should be able to pass this certification exam.
- While it will not be explicitly tested, the candidate must have a working knowledge of either Python or Scala. The exam is available in both languages.
